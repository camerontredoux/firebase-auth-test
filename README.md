# Firebase + Next.js Portfolio (plus some Rick and Morty API)

This website is a playground for me to test server-side rendering and Next.js. It is also my portfolio in a sense, and includes a side project where I query the Rick and Morty API and display data to the user. It also uses Firebase to authenticate and protect certain pages.
